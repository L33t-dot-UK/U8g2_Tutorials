![Alt text](/Thumb1.png?raw=true "U8G2 Animation Tutorial")

The code in this repo is designed to support tutorials found in the above references.

Videos in this Series;
1. Introduction
2. Connected an OLED Screen to a Arduino
3. Creating XBM images for use in Arduino IDE (Icon Folder)
4. Creating Animation's with U8G2 and Arduino IDE (Blocking_Animation Folder)
5. Creating an Animation Class (NonBlocking_Class Folder)
6. Turning the Class into a library (PL_Library Folder)
7. Using the Library in Arduino IDE (PL_Library Folder)
8. Tidying up the Class and Using PROGMEM

This video series will show you how to create animations with the U8G2 library using Arduino IDE. We will install the library, create bitmaps for use in Arduino IDE, animate the bitmaps then create a class and library enabling us to create animation objects and have multiple animations.
