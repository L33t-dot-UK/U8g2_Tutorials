# U8G2 ANIMATION TUTORIALS

### If you just want an animation library to draw animations on screen then goto the Library folder and install the completed version of this library. I have included some examples to make it easier for you to get started and the Library Reference is included in the Readme.md in the Library folder

The code in this repo is designed to support tutorials found in the above references.

Videos in this Series;
1. Introduction
2. Connecting an OLED Screen to a Arduino
3. Creating XBM images for use in Arduino IDE __(Icon Folder)__
4. Creating Animation's with U8G2 and Arduino IDE __(Blocking_Animation Folder)__
5. Creating an Animation Class __(NonBlocking_Class Folder)__
6. Turning the Class into a library __(PL_Library Folder)__
7. Using the Library in Arduino IDE __(PL_Library Folder)__
8. Tidying up the Class and Using PROGMEM

This video series will show you how to create animations with the U8G2 library using Arduino IDE. We will install the library, create bitmaps for use in Arduino IDE, animate the bitmaps then create a class and library enabling us to create animation objects and have multiple animations.
