The code in thos repo are designed to support the tutorials found in the above references. The videos in this series are details below;

Videos in this Series
1. Introduction
2.Connected an OLED Screen to a Arduino
3.Creating XBM images for use in Arduino IDE
4.Creating Animation's with U8G2 and Arduino IDE
5. Creating an Animation Class
6. Turning the Class into a library
7. Using the Library in Arduino IDE
8. Tidying up the Class and Using PROGMEM

This video series will show you how to create animations with the U8G2 library using Arduino IDE. We will install the library, create bitmaps for use in Arduino IDE, animate the bitmaps then create a class and library enabling us to create animation objects and have multiple animations.
