This library is what we created in tutorial 6. To install the library download this repo, open Arduino IDE; \
    -     Select "Sketch" -> "Include Library" -> "Add .Zip Library"
    
Then navigate to "L33T_PL_Animation.zip" (it's in the PL_Library folder) select it and click "Open" 

If you have any issues watch tutorial 7 where we download, install and use the library.

This library is a partial library and was used to demonstrate how to create an Arduino library, it will be expanded over the next couple of weeks to have more functionality, once this is done this you will be able to view the completed library in the Library folder of this repo.
